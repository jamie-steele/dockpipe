# Scripts

Run and act scripts in **one folder**. Mix and match with any workflow.

| Script | Type | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `clone-worktree.sh` | pre | Create worktree and export `DOCKPIPE_WORKDIR` + `DOCKPIPE_COMMIT_ON_HOST`. If `DOCKPIPE_USER_REPO_ROOT` is set (same `origin` as `DOCKPIPE_REPO_URL`), uses **`git worktree add` from that checkout** (new branch from **your current HEAD**; stashes uncommitted/untracked and `stash pop` in the worktree unless `DOCKPIPE_STASH_UNCOMMITTED=0`). Otherwise clones/fetches into `DOCKPIPE_DATA_DIR` and bases the worktree on **origin/HEAD** (mirror mode). |
| `commit-worktree.sh` | action | Triggers commit-on-host after container exit (commit runs on host). |
| `export-patch.sh` | action | Write uncommitted changes to a patch file. |
| `print-summary.sh` | action | Print exit code and git status summary. |

Use with `--run scripts/clone-worktree.sh`, `--act scripts/commit-worktree.sh`, or set `run:` and `act:` in a workflow config. Images live in **images/** at repo root.
