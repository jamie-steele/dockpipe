# Workflow YAML (`config.yml`)

**Workflow YAML** for **`--workflow <name>`** resolves to **`workflows/<name>/config.yml`** (when present), then **nested** **`config.yml`** under any directory listed in **`dockpipe.config.json` `compile.workflows`** (same roots **`dockpipe package compile workflows`** uses), then **`src/core/workflows/<name>/config.yml`** (bundled examples in a dockpipe checkout), or **`templates/<name>/config.yml`** (legacy project layout). The **materialized bundle cache** still uses a **`bundle/workflows/`** layout on disk (see **[install.md](install.md#bundled-templates-no-extra-install-tree)**).

## Recommended mental model

For most users, the main concepts are:

- **workflow** — what should happen
- **step** — one host or container action inside that workflow
- **runtime** — where a step runs
- **resolver** — which tool/profile the step uses

Everything else is secondary:

- **`isolate`** is the low-level image/template override
- **`strategy`** is an advanced lifecycle wrapper

If you are writing a normal workflow, prefer thinking in terms of **steps + runtime + resolver** first.

## Defaults and overrides

DockPipe uses a simple layering rule:

- top-level **`runtime`** and **`resolver`** set the **workflow default**
- step-level **`runtime`** and **`resolver`** **override** that default for one step
- **`isolate`** is the advanced low-level override when you need to pin the exact image/template

In practice, most workflows should:

1. set **`runtime`** and **`resolver`** once at the top
2. override them only on the few steps that genuinely differ
3. reach for **`isolate`** only when a step must pin a specific image/template rather than just a substrate/profile

**Workflows vs core slices:** **Runtimes** are **core-owned** execution substrates ( **`templates/core/runtimes/<name>/`** ). Workflow YAML may only **select** a substrate by **name** (`runtime`, per-step `runtime:`) — it does **not** define new runtime types or override how substrates work. **Resolvers** and **strategies** follow the same idea: **definitions** live under **`templates/core/resolvers/`**, **`strategies/`** (or maintainer trees under **`compile.workflows`**); the workflow **references** them — see **Authoring: workflow YAML vs resolver / runtime / strategy slices** in **[package-model.md](package-model.md)** and **[architecture-model.md](architecture-model.md)**. Resolver delegate YAML also loads from **`…/core/resolvers/<name>/config.yml`** next to the authoring core root (**`src/core/resolvers/…`** or **`templates/core/…`**) or **`bundle/core/resolvers/<name>/config.yml`** (materialized bundle). Load with **`dockpipe --workflow <name>`** (plus your command after **`--`**).

**Arbitrary-path workflow:** put the **same** YAML shape in any file (for example **`workflows/foo/config.yml`**) and run **`dockpipe --workflow-file <path>`** so **`run:`** / **`act:`** paths resolve relative to that file’s directory. **Resolver** profiles are **not** beside the file — they load only from **`templates/core/resolvers/`** (see below). Do not pass **`--workflow`** and **`--workflow-file`** together.

**Lint:** **`dockpipe workflow validate [path]`** — parses the workflow (including **`imports:`**) and checks against a small embedded JSON Schema. **`path`** is optional when exactly one **`workflows/*/config.yml`** exists under the workflows root. Otherwise pass a **relative** path (resolved from the current directory first, then from **DOCKPIPE_REPO_ROOT** / the materialized bundle root), for example **`workflows/test/config.yml`**.

**Terminology (same as the CLI):**

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **run** | Host scripts *before* the container (paths under `run:`). |
| **isolate** | Low-level image or template override. Most workflows should start with **`runtime`** + **`resolver`** and only set **`isolate`** when they want to pin the exact image/template. |
| **act** | Follow-up after the main command (usually a **host** script; see **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** for in-container `DOCKPIPE_ACTION`). |
| **workflow** | This file: a named preset selected with **`--workflow <name>`**. |
| **strategy** | Optional **named lifecycle** wrapper: small **`KEY=value`** files under **`templates/<workflow>/strategies/<name>`** (optional) or **`templates/core/strategies/<name>`** define host scripts to run **before** and **after** the workflow body. See [Named strategies](#named-strategies) below. |
| **runtime** / **resolver** | **Runtime** — **where** execution runs: **core** profiles under **`templates/core/runtimes/<name>`** (**`DOCKPIPE_RUNTIME_*`**). **Resolver** — **which tool/profile**: **`templates/core/resolvers/<name>`** (**`DOCKPIPE_RESOLVER_*`**). Those are the main selection knobs most workflows should use. In the materialized bundle, the same paths live under **`bundle/core/`**. See **[architecture-model.md](architecture-model.md)** · **[isolation-layer.md](isolation-layer.md)**. |

## Single-command vs multi-step

| Mode | When | `config.yml` |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Single flow** | No `steps:` (or empty) | Top-level **`run`**, **`runtime`** / **`resolver`** (or advanced **`isolate`**), and **`act`** / **`action`** describe one run. This is the compact shorthand for simple workflows. |
| **Multi-step** | Non-empty **`steps:`** | Each list item is a **step**. A step is either a **container step** (default) or a **host step** (`kind: host`). The CLI argument after `--` can supply the **last** step’s command if that step has no `cmd`/`command`. |

Variable precedence for workflows is documented in **[CLI reference](cli-reference.md)** (CLI > config > `.env` / `--env-file` / `--var`).

If a workflow grows beyond one simple run, prefer moving to **`steps:`** instead of piling more meaning onto top-level **`run`** / **`act`**.

### Host steps (`kind: host`)

Most steps are **container steps**. A step becomes a **host step** when you set **`kind: host`**.

For host steps, **`run:`** scripts execute on the host. Use **`kind: host`** when the step genuinely needs host-side behavior, such as:

- starting or stopping a local helper stack
- calling a host-only CLI
- launching a local GUI tool
- preparing files before a later container step

If a host step starts sidecars or helper containers, the runner can clean them up after the step. The exact marker files and cleanup internals are engine behavior; workflow authors usually only need to know that host steps may register cleanup state under **`.dockpipe/`** and that cleanup can be disabled with **`DOCKPIPE_SKIP_HOST_CLEANUP=1`** when a workflow wants to keep the sidecar alive deliberately.

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **`DOCKPIPE_LAUNCH_MODE`** | Optional hint for **`vars:`** / templates — e.g. **`gui`** means the step opens a **GUI** on the host (desktop app, not a detached “server” process). Scripts can print clearer messaging; dockpipe still **waits on the host script** until it exits unless the script itself returns early. |
| **`DOCKPIPE_SKIP_HOST_CLEANUP`** | If **`1`** or **`true`**, the runner **skips** **`ApplyHostCleanup`** after the host script exits (escape hatch: you stop containers yourself). |

---

## Top-level keys

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `name` | Optional display title for stderr (defaults to the template folder name, e.g. `run`). |
| `description` | Optional one-line task summary printed after `name` (e.g. what this workflow is for). |
| `category` | Optional **UI metadata** for tools like **Pipeon**: e.g. `app` marks a launchable GUI/container IDE-style workflow shown in **Basic** mode. Omit or use other values for pipelines and advanced-only flows. |
| `vars` | Map of default env vars (merged if not already set; `--var` overrides). |
| `compose` | Optional Docker Compose settings for host built-ins such as `compose_up`, `compose_down`, and `compose_ps`. Fields: `file`, `project`, `project_directory`, `autodown_env`, `exports`, `services`. Compose runs inherit DockPipe’s resolved environment and vault-injected vars directly. |
| `run` | String or list of host pre-script paths (repo `scripts/…` or paths under the template). Best for compact single-flow workflows. |
| `isolate` | Advanced low-level image/template override. Prefer **`runtime`** + **`resolver`** for the normal authoring path; use **`isolate`** when you need to pin the exact image/template. |
| `act` / `action` | Action script after the container command (when not using per-step act). Best for compact single-flow workflows. |
| `runtime` | Main **where does this run?** field. Names an existing **core** runtime profile under **`templates/core/runtimes/<name>`**. Also acts as the default for steps unless a step overrides it. |
| `resolver` | Main **which tool/profile does this use?** field. Names an existing **core** resolver profile under **`templates/core/resolvers/<name>`**. Also acts as the default for steps unless a step overrides it. |
| `steps` | List of **steps** (multi-step mode). |
| `imports` | List of paths (relative to this file) to merge **before** this file: each imported file’s **`vars`** are merged (later files override), then **`steps`** from imports run **before** **`steps`** here. Circular imports are rejected. Requires loading from disk (not raw bytes-only parse). Use this when you want to change the authored workflow itself. |
| `inject` | Compile-closure dependencies only. Use this when compile needs extra workflows/packages/resolvers included, but you do **not** want to merge their YAML into this workflow. |
| `strategy` | Default **strategy name** when the CLI does **not** pass **`--strategy <name>`**. |
| `strategies` | Optional allowlist: if non-empty, the effective strategy (CLI **`--strategy`** or **`strategy:`**) must be one of the listed names. |
| `docker_preflight` | Default **true**. When **false**, the runner skips the Docker reachability check before **`steps:`** if **no** step uses the container. Use for **host-only** workflows whose **`run:`** / **`pre_script`** scripts do **not** invoke Docker. If a script calls **`docker`**, keep the default or the workflow may fail later. |

### `imports` vs `inject`

These two fields solve different problems:

- **`imports`** changes the workflow you are authoring by merging in other YAML
- **`inject`** changes what compile must include, but does **not** merge YAML

If you want more vars or earlier steps to become part of this workflow, use **`imports`**.

If you want compile/package closure to include additional workflows, packages, or resolver profiles without changing this workflow’s authored structure, use **`inject`**.

---

## Named strategies

**Strategies** are reusable before/after wrappers for a workflow run. Use them when multiple workflows should share the same lifecycle behavior, such as worktree setup or commit-on-success.

Shared definitions live under **`templates/core/strategies/`**; see **[docs/architecture-model.md](architecture-model.md)** ( **`templates/core/`** layout ).

**Resolution order** for the strategy file path: **`--strategy <name>`** (overrides **`strategy:`** in YAML when both are set) → **`templates/<this-workflow>/strategies/<name>`** (beside that workflow’s `config.yml`, if present) → **`templates/core/strategies/<name>`** (see **`ResolveStrategyFilePath`** in **`src/lib/application/strategy.go`**).

**File format** (`KEY=value`, `#` comments):

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|--------|
| `DOCKPIPE_STRATEGY_BEFORE` | Comma-separated repo-relative script paths (under **`scripts/…`** from repo root, or paths relative to the workflow template dir), run **in order** on the host before **`run:`** / the container / **`steps:`**. |
| `DOCKPIPE_STRATEGY_AFTER` | Same, run **after** the workflow body completes successfully (exit **0**). Bundled **`scripts/commit-worktree.sh`** is treated like today’s commit-on-host path (single commit, no duplicate with workflow **`act:`** when the strategy owns commit). |
| `DOCKPIPE_STRATEGY_KIND` | Optional tag (e.g. `git`) for documentation only. |

**Built-in names** (bundled under **`templates/core/strategies/`**):

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| **`worktree`** | **`before`:** `scripts/clone-worktree.sh` · **`after`:** `scripts/commit-worktree.sh` — clone/worktree on the host, then resolver-driven isolate, then commit. There is **no** separate bundled workflow for this; add **`strategy: worktree`** to **your** `templates/<name>/config.yml` (or **`--workflow-file`**). |
| **`commit`** | **`after`:** commit only — e.g. **`run`** workflow. |

**Example** (your repo, e.g. **`templates/my-ai/config.yml`**):

```yaml
name: my-ai
strategy: worktree
strategies: [worktree, commit]
resolver: claude
```

Then: **`dockpipe --workflow my-ai --resolver claude --repo https://github.com/you/repo.git -- claude -p "…"`**

Do **not** list **`clone-worktree.sh`** in **`run:`** when **`worktree`** already provides clone (dockpipe will error). Do **not** duplicate bundled **`act:`** commit with the same strategy **`after`** hook.

---

## Step fields

Each **`-`** under `steps:` is one step (or a **`group`** wrapper — see [Async groups](#async-groups-parallelism) below).

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `id` | Optional. Used in stderr logs (e.g. `[merge]` lines). If omitted, logs use `step 1`, `step 2`, … |
| `cmd` / `command` | Shell command line inside the container (parsed for argv). |
| `run` | String or YAML list: host pre-scripts before this step’s container. |
| `pre_script` | Single extra pre-script path (in addition to `run`). |
| `isolate` | Template/image for this step (falls back to workflow / CLI / **core** runtime profile). |
| `kind` | Step kind. Use **`container`** (default) for normal isolated execution, or **`host`** for host-side actions. |
| `runtime` | Optional **core** runtime profile basename (same as CLI **`--runtime`** — must exist under **`templates/core/runtimes/`**). Overrides the workflow default for this step. |
| `resolver` | Optional **resolver** profile basename (same as CLI **`--resolver`**). Overrides the workflow default for this step. Do **not** use it for packaged workflow calls. |
| `workflow` | Marks this as a **packaged workflow step**. This is the **child workflow name** to run. |
| `package` | Required for a **packaged workflow step**. This is the **child workflow namespace** and must match the nested workflow’s **`namespace:`** in **`config.yml`** (resolution searches packaged / staging / **`workflows/`** trees on disk). |
| `act` / `action` | Action script for this step. |
| `vars` | Per-step env map (merged for that step; `--var` keys can be “locked”). |
| `outputs` | Path to a **dotenv-style** file (`KEY=value` lines) written by the step; merged into env for **later** steps. Default if omitted: `.dockpipe/outputs.env`. This is the normal way one step passes values forward to later steps. |
| `capture_stdout` | Host path (relative to **`DOCKPIPE_WORKDIR`** / **`--workdir`**) — container **stdout** is also appended to this file (still printed on the terminal). |
| `manifest` | Host path — after the step, dockpipe writes a small JSON file with **`exit_code`**, **`duration_ms`**, **`step_index`**, **`id`** (if set), and **`step_display`**. |
| `is_blocking` | Default **`true`**. If **`false`**, this step joins an **async group** with adjacent non-blocking steps (see below). |
| `host_builtin` | Optional engine-owned host action for `kind: host` steps. Supported values: `package_build_store`, `compose_up`, `compose_down`, `compose_ps`. Compose built-ins require top-level `compose.file`. |

### Step state flow

For most step-based workflows, the normal pattern is:

1. a step runs
2. it writes values to **`outputs`**
3. later steps see those values in their environment

If you are trying to pass state from one step to another, start with **`outputs`** before inventing custom temp-file or wrapper conventions.

All keys use **snake_case** in YAML (e.g. `is_blocking`, not `isBlocking`).

### Compose lifecycle example

```yaml
name: stack-demo
compose:
  file: assets/compose/docker-compose.yml
  project: dockpipe-dev
  project_directory: ../../..
  autodown_env: STACK_AUTODOWN
  exports:
    OLLAMA_HOST: http://host.docker.internal:11434
  services: [proxy]

steps:
  - id: stack_up
    kind: host
    host_builtin: compose_up

  - id: stack_status
    kind: host
    host_builtin: compose_ps

  - id: stack_down
    kind: host
    host_builtin: compose_down
```

If `compose.autodown_env` is set, `compose_down` is skipped when that env resolves to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`.

If `compose.exports` is set, those `KEY=value` pairs are merged into DockPipe’s workflow environment after a successful `compose_up` or `compose_ps`. That makes them available to later steps without an extra env-file layer.

---

## Async groups (parallelism)

**Mental model:** several steps run **concurrently**, then **one merge**, then the **next blocking** step runs with the merged env.

Prefer the explicit **`group: { mode: async }`** form when authoring new workflows. It is easier to read and reason about than relying on adjacency alone.

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Async group** | Prefer a single list entry **`group: { mode: async, tasks: [...] }`**. Consecutive steps with **`is_blocking: false`** still work as the compact expert form. |
| **Join point** | The **next** step with **`is_blocking: true`** (or default). It waits until **every** async member has finished. |
| **Inputs** | Each async member sees env from the **last blocking barrier** only, plus its own `vars` / pre-scripts — not siblings’ live env. |
| **Outputs** | After **all** async members finish, each member’s **`outputs:`** file is merged in **declaration order**. Same key → **later** step wins (same as sequential steps). |
| **Merge logging** | On collision during that merge, stderr shows: `[dockpipe] [merge] variable "KEY" overwritten by … (previously set by …)`. |

**Rules:**

- Within one async group, each step needs a **distinct** `outputs` **path** (duplicate paths are rejected).
- Host **commit-worktree** action cannot be used **inside** an async group.
- `kind: host` steps in a group only contribute at **merge** time (their `outputs` file).

### Recommended async form (`group`)

The entry must contain **only** the key `group` (no `cmd` beside it).

```yaml
steps:
  - id: setup
    cmd: echo ready
    is_blocking: true

  - group:
      mode: async
      tasks:
        - id: task_a
          cmd: sh -c 'echo BRANCH=a > .dockpipe/out-a.env'
          outputs: .dockpipe/out-a.env
        - id: task_b
          cmd: sh -c 'echo BRANCH=b > .dockpipe/out-b.env'
          outputs: .dockpipe/out-b.env

  - id: join
    cmd: sh -c 'echo $BRANCH'
    is_blocking: true
```

Inside `tasks:`, omitting `is_blocking` means **async** (forced non-blocking). **`is_blocking: true` inside `tasks`** is **invalid** and errors.

**Do not** nest another `group` inside `tasks` — unsupported; unknown keys on a step are ignored by the YAML decoder.

### Compact async form (`is_blocking: false`)

This is the same runtime behavior, but less explicit:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: setup
    cmd: echo ready
    is_blocking: true

  - id: task_a
    cmd: sh -c 'echo BRANCH=a > .dockpipe/out-a.env'
    is_blocking: false
    outputs: .dockpipe/out-a.env

  - id: task_b
    cmd: sh -c 'echo BRANCH=b > .dockpipe/out-b.env'
    is_blocking: false
    outputs: .dockpipe/out-b.env

  - id: join
    cmd: sh -c 'echo $BRANCH'
    is_blocking: true   # BRANCH=b (last in group wins)
```
---

## Chaining without `steps:`

Multiple **`dockpipe`** runs with the same **`--workdir`** are valid (fresh container each time). Example:

```bash
dockpipe --workdir "$R" -- make lint && dockpipe --workdir "$R" -- make test
```

Pipe stdout between runs if needed. Prefer **`steps:`** in **`config.yml`** when one workflow should own order, **`outputs:`**, and optional parallelism.

---

## Example workflows in this repo

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **[workflows/test/](../workflows/test/)** (this repo) | CI-style **go test** + **govulncheck** + **gosec** chain via **`.dockpipe/outputs.env`** — canonical repo path is **`workflows/`**, not **`templates/`**. |
| **[templates/run/](../templates/run/)** | Compact single-command shorthand in a container, then optional **git** commit on the current branch (**strategy `git-commit`**). |
| **[templates/run-apply/](../templates/run-apply/)** | Two-step **run → apply** pipeline (replace **`cmd:`** with your tools). |
| **[templates/run-apply-validate/](../templates/run-apply-validate/)** | Three-step **run → apply → validate** pipeline (replace **`cmd:`** with your tools). |

**Async groups** (`group.mode: async`) are documented above in this file.

```bash
dockpipe --workflow test
dockpipe --workflow run -- echo ok
dockpipe --workflow run-apply
dockpipe --workflow run-apply-validate
```

### Packaged workflow step

Use a packaged workflow call directly on the step:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: child
    workflow: child-name
    package: acme-team
```

That is the explicit nesting form. Do not write `runtime: package`.
